# Optimizing Term Deposit Sales Project
This repository contains the code and resources for my data mining project on optimizing term deposit sales. In this project, I used the bank telemarketing dataset from UCI to explore different data mining techniques and models to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing. It contains information about the marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, including customer demographics, campaign information, and previous banking history. The target variable in this dataset is whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit or not.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored different data mining techniques to optimize term deposit sales. The project is divided into the following sections:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature engineering
* Model selection and tuning
* Model evaluation and comparison
* Conclusion and future work

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to install the following packages:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
You can then run the Jupyter Notebook optimizing-term-deposit-sales.ipynb to reproduce the results and analysis in this project.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how different data mining techniques and models can be used to optimize term deposit sales. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection and tuning, we were able to achieve a high accuracy in predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

Future work for this project includes exploring more advanced machine learning models, incorporating more data sources, and performing more rigorous statistical analysis.
